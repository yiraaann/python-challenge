# python-challenge
detailed README file for python challenge written by Yiran Zhang

the source of my code was primarily from our class curriculum. I also asked the XPert Learning Assistant a lot of questions, which was helpful to me in both writing and debugging my code.

for PyPoll, I received assistance from a Tutor (CJ Campbell) on the list & dictionary creation portion. CJ also helped me lightly debug the code that I had already written ~90% of, and showed me how to better format the results of the analysis and its corresponding text file using the f command. I had been using "file=open("PyPoll.txt", "a")" at the end of each print command because I had previously been dealing with a lot of directory & fileload issues. Thankfully, I was able to get that straightened out, so am able to use f command all the time now!

for PyBank, I had been struggling for several days trying to append a 3rd column of differences from month to month indexed to the most recent such month. I then kept running into list & int issues before taking a long walk and realizing I could just designate a counter variable to keep track of net profit/loss and iterate through each row without needing to store the month to month difference after testing it against a "greatest increase" and "greatest decrease" variable.

grateful to have finally gotten to the bottom of all the (obvious) issues
